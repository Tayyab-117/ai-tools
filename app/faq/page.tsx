      <h2>Do my files leave my device?</h2>
      <p>No. The tools here are designed to run in your browser using Web APIs. Unlike many online tools, your data stays with you.</p>
      <h2>Why are some features basic?</h2>
      <p>To keep everything private and fast, we avoid heavy server processing. We focus on fast, useful actions that can run locally.</p>
      <h2>Will you add more tools?</h2>
      <p>Yes! This site uses a registry pattern, so adding tools is quick. Check the Tools page regularly for new releases.</p>
      <h2>How do you keep it free?</h2>
      <p>Community donations and sponsors. If these tools help you, consider supporting the project.</p>
